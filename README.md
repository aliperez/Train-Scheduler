# Train-Scheduler

This project was a homework assignment for the UCSD Coding Bootcamp.

This app is designed to be admin-facing.  An administrator will add the name of a train, it's desitination, the time of the first departure for the day, and the frequency with which it departs.  The app then calculates the time of the next arrival (based on current time) and how many minutes are remaining until it arrives.  The Current Train Schedule is then displayed in an easy to read format for passengers.
